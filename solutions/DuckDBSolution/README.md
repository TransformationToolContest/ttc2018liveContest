# SQL solution

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) solution for the TTC 2018 Live case.

## Prerequisites

PostgreSQL 12 is required. On Ubuntu 20.04, it can be installed by running `apt-get install postgresql-12`. On older systems please refer to [[1](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-postgresql-12-on-ubuntu/), [2](https://pgdash.io/blog/postgres-11-getting-started.html)].

## Generate CSV models and changes

Use the `modelToGraphConverter` Gradle task to generate the CSV models. Pass desired model size in the `modelSize` project property.

Merge FK models will be output as `models/$modelSize/csv-*-initial.csv`, graph models will be output as `models/$modelSize/graph-*-initial.csv`.

```bash
./gradlew modelMergeFkConverter -PmodelSize=4
./gradlew modelToGraphConverter -PmodelSize=4
```

CSV change sets (`changes-*.csv` files) can be generated with the `modelChangeProcessor` Gradle task:

```bash
./gradlew modelChangeProcessor -PmodelSize=4 -Psequences=20
```

## Configuring the database

The default configuration uses the `ttc2018sf1` database. On a typical Ubuntu install, you might want to run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

To allow access from JDBC, you have to set a password. For example, to set the default password of user `postgres` to `foo`, issue the following command:

```sql
ALTER ROLE postgres PASSWORD 'foo';
```

If you want to create a separate user `ttcuser` with the password `secret`, use the following commands:

```sql
CREATE USER ttcuser PASSWORD 'secret';
ALTER ROLE ttcuser WITH login createdb superuser;
```

## Allow access for ttcuser

For the command-line operations, you can allow `ttcuser` to access the database.

:warning: Warning: never do this on a production system.

Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file and add the following line at the beginning of the file:

```
local all ttcuser trust
```

## Loading the data set

### Generating the data set

See above in Sec. *Generate CSV models*.

### Loading the data set

To run the load script, go the `load-scripts` directory, set the `PG_` environment variables (optional) and issue the following command:

```bash
export MODEL_SIZE=
export PG_DATA_DIR=
export PG_DB_NAME=
export PG_USER=
export PG_PORT=
./load.sh
```

If `MODEL_SIZE` is set, the model directory is inferred unless overridden by `PG_DATA_DIR`.

The `load.sh` has default options that loads the dataset of size 1 to the `ttc2018sf1` database with your current user. If these fit your needs, just run the script as `./load.sh`.

If you get *Permission denied* errors, change the permissions of your home directory to 755 - but please make sure you understand its implications first:

```bash
chmod 755 ~
```

To play around with the data, connect to PostgreSQL and switch to the database:

```console
postgres=# \c ttc2018sf1
You are now connected to database "ttc2018sf1" as user "postgres".
ttc2018sf1=# SELECT count(*) FROM users;
# ...
```

For a detailed example on how to use Postgres, see the CI configuration file (`.travis.yml` in the repository root).
