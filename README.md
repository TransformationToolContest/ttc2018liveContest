# The TTC 2018 Social Media Case

[![Build status](https://github.com/TransformationToolContest/ttc2018liveContest/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TransformationToolContest/ttc2018liveContest/actions)
 
## Case description

The `docs/2018_TTC_Live.pdf` file contains the [case description](https://github.com/TransformationToolContest/ttc2018liveContest/raw/master/docs/2018_TTC_Live.pdf).

## Prerequisites

* 64-bit operating system
* Python 3.3 or higher
* R

## Setup

The graph models are stored in the `models` directory. For sizes larger than 512, the files are zipped so make sure you unzip the required sizes first. For example, run:

```bash
cd models
unzip 1024.zip
cd ..
```

## Regenerating CSV change sets

CSV change sets are generated based on the XMI (EMF) models. The instructions for regenerating the CSVs are detailed in the [SQL solution's README](solutions/SQLSolution/README.md).

## Solution Prerequisites

* AOF, ATL: Requires Java 8 for build (can run with Java 11).
* Hawk: Requires Java (both 8 and 11 have been tested and work).
* JastAdd: Requires Java 8 for running (already built).
* NMF: You need to install [.NET Core 3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-package-manager-ubuntu-1804)
* SQL: Requires PostgreSQL 11 or later.
* YAMTL: Requires Java 11 for running (already built).
* Differential: Requires Rust and Cargo.

Add your prerequisites here!

## Using the framework

The `scripts` directory contains the `run.py` script.
At a first glance, invoke it without any arguments so that the solution will be built, benchmarked, running times visualized and the results compared to the reference solution's.
One might fine tune the script for the following purposes:
* `run.py -b` -- builds the projects
* `run.py -b -s` -- builds the projects without testing
* `run.py -m` -- run the benchmark without building
* `run.py -v` -- visualizes the results of the latest benchmark
* `run.py -c` -- check results by comparing them to the reference output. The benchmark shall already been executed using `-m`.
* `run.py -t` -- build the project and run tests (usually unit tests as defined for the given solution)
* `run.py -d` -- runs the process in debug mode, i.e. with the `Debug` environment variable set to `true`

The `config` directory contains the configuration for the scripts:
* `config.json` -- configuration for the model generation and the benchmark
  * `run.py` reads configuration from this file. During the Docker-based execution, this file contains the generic settings that are copied to the separate image-specific files. The default values in this file is used in CI.
  * *Note:* the timeout as set in the benchmark configuration (default: 60 seconds) applies to the gross cumulative runtime of the tool for a given changeset and update sequences. This also includes e.g. Initialization time which is not required by the benchmark framework to be measured.
    Timeout is only applied to the solutions' run phase (see `-m` for `run.py`), so it is not applied to e.g. the build phase (see `-b` for `run.py`).
* `reporting.json` -- configuration for the visualization

### Setting the heap size

By default, Java tools run with a heap size - both minimum (`Xms`) and maximum (`Xmx`) - of 6 GB.
This can be set to `«HEAP»` GB with the following script (using [`ag`](https://geoff.greer.fm/ag/)).

```bash
ag 'Xm(s|x)[0-9]+G' -l0 | xargs -0 sed -i -r 's/Xm(s|x)[0-9]+G/Xm\1«HEAP»G/g'
```

### Running the benchmark

The script runs the benchmark for the given number of runs, for the specified tools and change sequences.

The benchmark results are stored in a CSV file. The header for the CSV file is stored in the `output/header.csv` file.

## Reporting and visualization

Make sure you read the `README.md` file in the `reporting` directory and install all the requirements for R.

## Implementing the benchmark for a new tool

To implement a tool, you need to create a new directory in the solutions directory and give it a suitable name.

## Running the benchmark with Docker

Instructions for running the benchmark starting with a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 VM.

### Initialize server

In case of cloud virtual machines (e.g. Amazon EC2, Azure), first create a file system and mount it. Example, assuming the `/dev/nvme1n1` device mounting to `/mnt/data`:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme1n1
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mnt/data
```

### Docker

On Ubuntu 20.04, the Docker version installed from `apt` is sufficient. If you wish to install the latest Docker, follow [the official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

Install Docker with `apt`:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker
```

Configure Docker to run without `sudo`:
```bash
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
newgrp docker
```

Change Docker's storage location by editing `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
```bash
sudo vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

Set the `data-root` of Docker (where the containers are stored) to a location with ample space (e.g. the newly mounted disk):
Assuming your storage is `/mnt/data`, use the following configuration:
```json
{
  "data-root": "/mnt/data"
}
```

Restart Docker:
```bash
sudo service docker restart
```

### Images

The Docker images are defined in the `docker` directory as `Dockerfile-$TAG`, e.g. `Dockerfile-java11` contains the Docker image for running tool using Java 11.

The tools supported by each image are defined in the `config` directory in the `config/config-$TAG.json` file.

### Building and running the images

:warning: Do not unzip the `1024.zip` file.

- `git pull`
- Save measurement results (`output/*`) if necessary
- Clean all files to have a clean build:\
`git clean -ixd` then `c` for clean if asked.
- Make sure there are no changes: `git status`
- If the online images are fresh, pull the images:\
`./docker.sh --pull`
- Build outdated images or not uploaded (without running the tests):\
`./docker.sh --build-if-not-fresh`
- Set the desired configuration in `config/config.json` (with the exception of "Tools")\
E.g. `Timeout`: `600` s, `ChangeSets`: `"1", "2", "4", "8", "16", "32", "64", "128", "256", "512", "1024"`
- Copy generic settings from `config.json` to `config-docker-*.json` files:\
`docker/set-configs.sh`
- Run measurements with the desired Java heap size: (limit the CPU cores if needed: `--cpus 0-7`)\
`/usr/bin/time -v ./docker.sh -r --java-heap-size 60G |& tee -a output/log-$(date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H.%M.%S").log`

Run `./docker.sh` to list other available options.

### Software versions

To get the exact versions of software, use:

```bash
lsb_release -d
docker --version
docker run --rm -it ftsrg/ttc2018:java8 java -version
docker run --rm -it ftsrg/ttc2018:java11 java -version
docker run --rm -it ftsrg/ttc2018:net31 dotnet --info
```
